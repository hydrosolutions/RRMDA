testing/testRunModel contains a simple hand made testing suite for runModel_Themi.

testReadingSubAndForecastDataAndWritingDB.m tests if the data read in 
runModel_Themi corresponds to the data that is stored in runModel_Themi. 

testAssimilation.m creates a test environment for assimilation.m, runs 
assimilation.m and tests the results against expected values. The test 
environment is cleaned up automatically by testAssimilation.m.
